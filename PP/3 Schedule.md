#Project schedule
In this section we are going to provide a high-level schedule of the tasks involved in the projects.  
Even if we did not go through implementation, testing and system deployment, we thought it was meaningful to include them as a part of the schedule in order to have a more complete overview of the overall plan devised for the project.

In order to maximize readability, we will present four separate schedules, one per each development phase. They are to be thought one after the other, in the order we present them. However, there are dates on top of each schedule which define the right period in which each activity is planned.

At the end of each development phase, a corresponding document is produced.

__Important note__: Even if code ispection is indicated in the activities with its own performance period, it has not to be intended as a continuous activity. In the diagram, we have indicated the interval over time in which code inspections sessions will be held. Code inspection schedule is to be defined later in the development workflow, according to the availability of the external company performing the inspections.

##Deployment
