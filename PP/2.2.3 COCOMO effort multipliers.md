#### Analyst Capability (ACAP)
This effort multiplier accounts for the aggregate ability of the analyst team to communicate, cooperate and design, it also account for the efficiency and thoroughness of the team.
Since we have dedicated much time in the effort of analysing the problem
 requirements we can rate this effort multiplier at a level of **high** (coefficient: 0.85)
#### Programmer Capability (PCAP)
This effort multiplier accounts for the aggregate ability of the programmer team to communicate and cooperate, it also account for the efficiency and thoroughness of the team.
Our cooperation started some years ago and since then we have already developed different software product and thus our ability to cooperate is rated **high** (coefficient: 0.88)
#### Personnel Continuity (PCON)
This effort multiplier accounts for the project's annual personnel turnover.
Since our development team is stable, no personnel turnover is expected, and so we rate this as **very high** (coefficient: 0.81)
#### Applications Experience (APEX)
This effort multiplier accounts for the application experience of the team in developing the software system.
Since this application field (car sharing) is new to our developing team we set this effort multiplier to **very low** (coefficient: 1.22)
#### Platform Experience (PLEX)
This effort multiplier accounts for the knowledge in many platforms such as graphic user interface, database, networking&hellip;
Since this knowledge is around 1 year, we can rate this effort multiplier at a level of **nominal** (coefficient: 1.00)
#### Language and Tool Experience (LTEX)
This effort multiplier accounts for the level of the programming language and the software tool experience of the project team.
Software development also includes program styles and tools for the requirements and design reprenentation and analysis.
We have mixed experience in language and tools in fact we have a solid experience of more than 3 years in Javascript, HTML and CSS;
an experience of about 1 year in Java, and some experience in modelling language such as Alloy. Considering all these factor we opted
 for a level of **nominal** (coefficient: 1.00)
#### Use of Software Tools (TOOL)
This effort multiplier accounts for the use of tools helping the team at different project stages.
The tools can be from a simple debugger to a more integrated system and since we plan to use tools like Eclipse as IDE, Maven as dependency manager, GIT as versioning tool,
and some tool for testing we can rate this effort multiplier at a level of **high** (coefficient: 0.90) 
#### Multisite Development (SITE)
This effort multiplier takes into account two factors: the site collocation and the communication support.
Even if we work from different city (**nominal** rate for site collocation) we plan to usually have meetings in Milan and in addition we plan to use chats and email
so we can rate the communication support at a level of **very high**. Combining the two factors yields a global rate of level **high** (coefficient: 0.93)
#### Required Development Schedule (SCED)
This effort multiplier measures the schedule constraint imposed on the project team. While accelerated schedules tend to produce more effort in the earlier phases to reduce risks, we
are fine with a normal schedule with no stretches, we rate this factor at a level of **nominal** (coefficient: 1.00)
