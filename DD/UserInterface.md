#User Interface Design
This section describes with a standard UX diagram the user interface to be implemented both in _User Application_ and _Employee Application_. This section does not include any mockup of the final application, as they were already included in the RASD.
Three diagrams are provided, the first describes login and registration interfaces, the second describes the user interface for the _User Application_, and the third describes the user interface for the _Employee Application_. According to RASD, both applications provide breadcrumbs navigation.

##Login and registration

The "ok" action of the login form triggers the loading of the appropriate start page, that is modeled with the screen named "SearchCarGPS" for a user, and with the screen named "ViewCars" for an employee
