# TODOS
* Give a name to the SYSTEM
* In use case "registration", there is a incoherence with requirements - need fixup

### Use cases
#### Registration
##### Actors
* User
* External system for driving licence validation
* External system for credit card parameters validation
##### Entry condition
* User is not registered to SYSTEM
##### Flow of events
* The user activates the _sign up_ function on his terminal. SYSTEM responds by presenting him a form.
* The user fills the form, inserting his complete name, birth date, driving licence number, credit card number and CVV, along with a username and a password. Once the form is completed, the user submits it.

* User is not banned
##### Exceptions
* Information submitted to SYSTEM by the user is not complete or wrong. In this case, user is notified of the error(s) and registration procedure fails.

* User chooses whether to search for cars near his current position or near a target address, and fills the form entering the radius of the search and, if he has chosen to search by address, the target address, then he submits the form.
* If search by address was chosen, __address translation into geographical coordinates__ use case is called
* SYSTEM queries the list of cars searching for available cars that fit user parameters (search center expressed by its geographical coordinates and search radius)
* * SYSTEM responds to the user's terminal with a list of the available cars, each one charcterized by its unique identification number, its position (expressed by its geographical coordinates) and its battery level
* The user terminal builds a map in which car positions are highlighted with a pin reporting the car identification number and a list of all cars reporting, for each car, identification number, position (expressed by its geographical coordinates) and battery level
##### Exit condition
* The user has received a list of all cars that fit its search parameters
##### Exceptions
* If no car is found, the user is notified of the unavailability of cars
* If address cannot be translated into geographical coordinates, user is notified of the impossibility to perform the search

#### Address translation into geographical coordinates
##### Actors
* External system for address translation
##### Entry condition
* SYSTEM is processing an address-based search
##### Flow of events
* SYSTEM queries the external service with the address to translate
* The external service responds with the geographical coordinates of the address
##### Exit condition
* Address is translated into geographical coordinates
##### Exceptions

#### Car reservation
##### Actors
* User
##### Entry conditions
* User is logged in
* User is not banned

##### Flow of events
* User activates the _reserve car_ function on his terminal. A request carring as its payload the unique identification number of the selected car is sent to SYSTEM.
* SYSTEM checks that the car is actually available
* SYSTEM checks that the user has no reservation for other cars belonging to the region to which the selected car belongs
* SYSTEM reserves the target car for the user
* User is notified of the result of the operation
##### Exit conditions
* Car requested by the user is reserved
* The reservor user of the selected car is the user who issued the request
##### Exceptions
* If car is not available, SYSTEM notifies the user of the error. The user can then select another car.
* If the user has already a reserved car in the same geographical region, SYSTEM notifies the user of the error. The user can select another car.
##### Special requirements
* SYSTEM checks and car reservation must be performed as a unique atomic sequence.


#### Reservation expiration
##### Actors

#### Additional fees/discounts computation
##### Actors
_No other actor than SYSTEM is involved_

    - -10% if for all the duration of the ride, SYSTEM detected that 3 or more people (including the driver) were con the car
    - -20% if residual battery level is greater or equal to 50% of full charge level
    - -30% if the car is actually plugged to a power source
    - +30% if battery level is less then 20% of full charge level
    - +30% if the car is parked more than 3km far from the nearest recharging station
* SYSTEM algebraically adds the computed amounts to the amount of the bill associated to the ride under consideration
##### Exit condition
* The user bill includes additional fees and discounts contribution
